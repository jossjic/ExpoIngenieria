## Project Description

The Engineering Expo is a project spanning 6 months of development, aimed at creating a complete web page (Frontend and Backend) designed for project management at the Monterrey Institute of Technology. The platform aims to facilitate efficient project management, allowing users to collaborate, supervise, and present relevant information.

## Technologies Used

To carry out this project, various technologies have been used to address different aspects of development:

- **Backend:**
  - PHP: Used for server logic and interaction with the database.
  - MySQL: Database management system for efficiently storing and retrieving data.

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML5: Structuring web content.
  - CSS3 and SCSS: Styles and design to enhance visual presentation.
  - JavaScript: Implementing interactivity and dynamic functionalities on the client side.
